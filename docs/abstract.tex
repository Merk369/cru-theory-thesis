We present the Causal Resonance Unification (CRU) framework, a resonance-based approach to unifying the Standard Model, gravitation, and cosmology under a single principle. At its core, CRU modifies the mass–energy equivalence relation,
\[
m c^2 = \hbar \omega \zeta ,
\]
where particle masses correspond to resonant frequencies and $\zeta$ encodes interaction dressing. This formulation anchors physical constants directly to measurable frequencies, offering a falsifiable alternative to string theory and other untested frameworks.

We derive the resonance field equations, stress–energy tensor, and dispersion relations, and demonstrate renormalization group stability across scales. CRU reproduces known particle masses, aligns with cosmological constraints (BBN, CMB, structure formation), and suggests testable predictions in resonance scanning experiments. 

Unlike prior unification attempts, CRU is experimentally falsifiable: failure to detect resonance locking within defined precision windows rules out the theory. This thesis documents the full formalism, data verification tables, cosmological limits, and experimental roadmap, positioning CRU as a clean, testable foundation for physics beyond the Standard Model.
