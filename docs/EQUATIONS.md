### **Eq. (1) â€” Defining Equation of CRU**
\[
m c^2 = \hbar \, \omega \, \zeta
\]

Mass is locked resonance energy; \(\zeta\) encodes dressing and interaction effects.

---

### **Eq. (2) â€” Resonance Field Equation of Motion**
\[
\Box \mathcal{R} - V'(\mathcal{R}) - \xi \, \mathcal{R} \, \mathcal{R}_{g} = J_{\text{res}}
\]

Dynamics of the resonance field \(\mathcal{R}\) with curvature and source couplings.

### **Eq. (3) â€” Stressâ€“Energy Tensor of â„›**
\[
T^{\mathcal{R}}_{\mu\nu} =
\partial_\mu \mathcal{R}\,\partial_\nu \mathcal{R}
- g_{\mu\nu}\Big(\tfrac{1}{2}\partial^\alpha \mathcal{R}\,\partial_\alpha \mathcal{R} - V(\mathcal{R})\Big)
+ \xi\Big(G_{\mu\nu}\mathcal{R}^2 - \nabla_\mu\nabla_\nu \mathcal{R}^2 + g_{\mu\nu}\Box \mathcal{R}^2\Big)
\]

Energyâ€“momentum structure of â„›, conserving under equations of motion.

### **Eq. (4) â€” Dispersion Relation for â„› Fluctuations**
\[
\omega^2 = c^2 k^2 + m_{\text{eff}}^2 + \alpha \frac{k^4}{\Lambda^2} + \beta \frac{k^6}{\Lambda^4} + \cdots
\]

Resonance fluctuations include higher-order corrections; ensures causality.

### **Eq. (5) â€” Renormalization Group Flows**
\[
\mu \frac{d\lambda_4}{d\mu} = \beta_{\lambda_4}, \quad 
\mu \frac{d m_\mathcal{R}^2}{d\mu} = \gamma_m m_\mathcal{R}^2, \quad 
\mu \frac{d\kappa_i}{d\mu} = \sum_j \Gamma_{ij}\kappa_j
\]

Running of resonance couplings and stability across scales.
